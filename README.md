# facebook_BOT
This bot is built using python and selenium it takes a csv file with names as an input then searches for each name on facebook.
It then sends a friend request to the first person found.

I use time.sleep alot so facebook doesn't block the account being used (because the bot will click and type so fast making it obvious its a bot).
